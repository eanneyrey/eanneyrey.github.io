<h1> August E. Neyrey IV Homepage </h1>

<p class=intro> My name is August Neyrey, although I go by Ean. I'm an undergradute at Illinois Institute of Technology. I'm currently majoring in Behavioral Health and Wellness with a speciialization in Food Science and Nutrition. I hope to get my Masters in Food Safety and Technology before becoming a Food Safety Officer for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

<h2 class=research> Research </h2>

<p> I first started my research under Nicole Legate, PhD. Dr. Legate's research focuses primarily on health disparities faced by members of the LGBTQ; and as a gay man myself, I was drawn to  her research. She also focuses on the costs of social exclusion for both the excluded and the excluder. </p>

<p> I am currently leading a study that is looking at people's perspectives and opinions of cow's milk and plant-based beverages. I helped to design the study in its entirety as well as run participants. This will be a two to three part study, but at the conclusion of all parts, I hope to be able to publish the findings in a research journal. </p>

<p> I also do research looking at health disparities (specifcally nutrtion and food availability) between priveleged and marganlized groups, such as foster youth and American Indians. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2 class=hobbies> Hobbies </h2>

<p> Some of my hobbies include Olympic weightlifting and CrossFit. Weightlifting has served as a great way for me to maintain balance in my life as well stay active with my busy schedule. I reguarly compete in weightlifting meets a few times a year. </p>
